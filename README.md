# Overview #

Welcome to the VVhitespace language. This repository provides two main tools.

A compiler, `vvc`, accepts human-readable VVhitespace source code and translates
it to true VVhitespace code. VVhitespace code is represented with the *whitespace
characters* `[tTvVsSnN]` corresponding to `[Tab]`, `[Vtab]`, `[Space]`,
`[Newline]`, respectively. The first character on a line which is not from this
set begins a comment which ends with the line. See the standard library for
examples in this style.

An interpreter, `vvi`, accepts true VVhitespace files as generated by `vvc` and
executes them according to the rules in `reference.md`.


# Instructions #

To build the VVhitespace software, simply run `make` in the top level directory.
This will produce two binaries, `vvc` for compiling human-readable
pseudo-vvhitespace into true vvhitespace, and `vvi` for interpreting/executing
vvhitespace programs.

Use these two programs to build and run your VVS programs:

    vvc -i your_code.pvvs -o output_file.vvs
    vvi -i output_file.vvs


# Examples #

The `examples/` folder contains examples with Makefiles. Simply `cd` into an
example and `make run` to build and execute it. Don't forget to build `vvc`
and `vvi` first! More details can be found in `examples/README.md`.


# Standard Library #

A standard library provides a few convenience functions. More details can be found
in `stdlib/README.md`. A working example can be found in `examples/hello-stdlib`.
