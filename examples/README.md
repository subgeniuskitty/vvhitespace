# Overview #

This folder contains example VVhitespace programs.

Each program can be built and run by executing `make run` in the example
sub-directory.

Running `make clean` in a specific example sub-directory will clean up all
build-related files for that example. Executing the same command in the
top-level `examples/` directory will clean up every example.

Before running any examples, first run `make` in the top-level VVhitespace
folder to build `vvc` and `vvi`.
